## Toolkits

- [Tint](http://tint.fbk.eu/)
  > Tint (The Italian NLP Tool) is a Java-based pipeline for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Italian. It is very fast and accurate, and implements most of the common linguistic tools, such as part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing. The tool is based on Stanford CoreNLP, and can be used as a stand-alone tool, included as a Java library or as a REST API service. Tint also includes wrappers (for third-party tools) that use the CoreNLP paradigm and therefore can be applied to languages different than Italian.
